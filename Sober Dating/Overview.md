This will be a dating app similar to Tinder and other alternatives that focuses on a user base that are sober. There are some existing apps but the primary audience is the US market, this one will focus on the UK market.

Key aims for me as the developer is to create a simple user friendly experience with the advantage of using our app over other alternatives being is clean user interface. The technologies that build up this app will be Supabase for the back end user management and data storage saving building a custom back end. The main app will be built using React native giving easy export to both Android and IOS.

The user interface will be designed using Penpot then translated to react native.
